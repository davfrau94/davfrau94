### Hi there, I'm Davide 👋🏻

I'm a bartender shifting into tech, currently studying **Full Stack Web Development** through self-learning and the [Start2Impact University](https://www.start2impact.it/) platform.  
I balance a demanding work schedule with focused daily coding sessions, driven by curiosity and long-term goals.

🔧 I enjoy building clean, responsive websites and documenting everything I learn using **Obsidian**.

💡 I'm especially interested in:
- Modern Web technologies
- Consistent, real-world learning through projects
- Personal Knowledge Management Systems
- Books

Outside tech, I stay active with **calisthenics** and **running**, and I aim to live a mindful, balanced life. 🧘🏻
